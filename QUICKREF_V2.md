## 🚀 QUICK START

```bash
# 1. Run the program
python main.py

# 2. In RECOGNIZE mode, press 'r' to record gesture
# 3. Perform gesture for 2 seconds
# 4. Press 'r' to stop
# 5. Hear voice output (if sign is recognized)

# To switch modes:
# Press 'm' to toggle RECORD/RECOGNIZE

# To record a new sign:
# Press 'n' → enter sign name → press 'r' to record

# To quit:
# Press 'q'
```

## 🔧 FEATURES

✅ **Continuous Loop** - Never exits until you press 'q'  
✅ **Mode Toggle** - Switch RECORD ↔ RECOGNIZE with 'm'  
✅ **Voice Output** - Hears recognized signs (pyttsx3)  
✅ **DTW Threshold** - Filters low-confidence matches  
✅ **Live Display** - Mode, progress, distance all shown  
✅ **No Restarts** - Record multiple signs in one session

## 📊 DISPLAY MEANINGS

| Text | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Red "MODE: RECORD" | Currently in Record mode |
| Green "MODE: RECOGNIZE" | Currently in Recognize mode |
| "🎥 Recording..." | Collecting frames |
| "Sign: 'hello'" | Recording this sign name |
| "DTW Distance: X" | Match confidence (lower = better) |
| Red circle | Currently recording |
| Green/White circle | Idle/Recognized |
| "Recognized: <name>" | Best match found |

---

## 🔊 VOICE OUTPUT

**Speaks when:**
- ✅ Sign recognized with good confidence
- ✅ Different sign than before
- ✅ In RECOGNIZE mode
- ✅ Not currently recording

**Doesn't speak:**
- ❌ During recording
- ❌ "Unknown Sign" (too far from threshold)
- ❌ Same sign repeated

## ⚙️ DEFAULT SETTINGS

| Setting | Value | How to Change |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| DTW Threshold | 2000 | Edit sign_recorder.py |
| Voice Speed | 150 wpm | Edit utils/voice_output.py |
| Voice Volume | 0.9 | Edit utils/voice_output.py |
| Recording Frames | 50 | Edit sign_recorder.py |

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: No voice output**
- Solution: Check pyttsx3 is installed: `pip install pyttsx3`

**Problem: Poor recognition**
- Solution: Record 3-5 examples per sign

**Problem: Too many "Unknown Sign"**
- Solution: Lower DTW threshold (edit sign_recorder.py)

**Problem: Too many false positives**
- Solution: Raise DTW threshold

**Problem: Webcam not opening**
- Solution: Close other apps using camera

**Problem: Program won't quit**
- Solution: Press 'q' (or Ctrl+C in terminal)

## 🎓 LEARNING TIPS

1. **Record clear gestures** - Consistent hand movements
2. **Good lighting** - Ensure hands are well-lit
3. **Multiple examples** - Record 3-5 per sign
4. **Same distance** - Always ~1 meter from camera
5. **Adjust threshold** - If too many unknowns/false positives

## 🔮 FUTURE FEATURES (TODO)

Two enhancements marked for future development:
1. **Static Alphabet** - A-Z sign recognition (separate ML model)
2. **Speech-to-Sign** - Voice input to sign translation
