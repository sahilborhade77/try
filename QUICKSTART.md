## Tips for Best Results

1. **Consistent Distance**: Stand 0.5-1.5 meters from the camera
2. **Good Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting on your hands
3. **Clear Gestures**: Make deliberate, clear hand movements
4. **Record Multiple Examples**: Save 3-5 examples of each sign for better accuracy
5. **Stable Posture**: Keep your arms and body relatively still

## File Structure After Use

```
data/
  signs/
    hello/
      sequence_20260121_010452.npy
      sequence_20260121_010459.npy
    thanks/
      sequence_20260121_011000.npy
    goodbye/
      sequence_20260121_011015.npy
```

Each `.npy` file contains:
- Sign name
- Left hand landmarks (50 frames × 63 values)
- Right hand landmarks (50 frames × 63 values)
- Timestamp metadata

## Troubleshooting

**Q: "No reference signs found" message appears**
A: Record at least one sign in Record mode first

**Q: Webcam not showing**
A: Make sure no other app is using your webcam. Try closing other programs.

**Q: Poor recognition accuracy**
A: Record more examples (3-5) of each sign. Ensure consistent gestures.

**Q: Program runs slow**
A: This is normal on first use. DTW computation is CPU-intensive. It gets faster.
