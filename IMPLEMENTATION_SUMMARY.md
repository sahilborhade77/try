# Sign Language Recognition System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### Overview
A fully functional real-time sign language recognition system with **dual modes**:
1. **Record Mode** - Create reference sign datasets
2. **Recognize Mode** - Recognize live gestures using saved signs

---

## MODE 1: RECORD SIGN (Reference Data Creation) ✅

### Implemented Features:
- ✅ Keyboard-controlled recording mode (press 'r' to start/stop)
- ✅ User input for sign name via `input()` prompt
- ✅ Records 50-frame gesture sequences
- ✅ Saves to disk as `.npy` files with metadata
- ✅ Organized file structure: `data/signs/<sign_name>/sequence_<timestamp>.npy`
- ✅ Automatic directory creation for new signs
- ✅ Frame counter display: "🎥 Recording Gesture... (X/50 frames)"

### Key Files:
- **`utils/sign_storage.py`** - Save/load functionality
  - `save_sign_sequence()` - Persists gestures to disk
  - `load_all_sign_sequences()` - Loads all saved signs
  - `get_available_signs()` - Lists existing signs

- **`sign_recorder.py`** - Record mode logic
  - `record(sign_name)` - Starts recording with sign name
  - `_save_sign()` - Persists to disk
  - `stop_recording()` - Cleanup

- **`main.py`** - User mode selection
  - Interactive prompt for mode choice
  - Sign name input and validation

---

## MODE 2: RECOGNIZE SIGN (DTW Matching) ✅

### Implemented Features:
- ✅ Automatic loading of saved reference signs on startup
- ✅ Live gesture recording (50 frames, same as reference)
- ✅ DTW-based comparison using FastDTW algorithm
- ✅ Minimum distance selection (best match = lowest DTW distance)
- ✅ Multi-sequence voting (compares against all saved examples)
- ✅ Distance computation separate for left/right hands
- ✅ Error handling when no signs are available
- ✅ Displays "No reference signs available" if needed

### Key Files:
- **`sign_recorder.py`** - Recognition logic
  - `_compute_distances_and_predict()` - DTW computation
  - `_compute_dtw_distance()` - FastDTW wrapper
  - `sign_sequences` - Loaded reference data in memory

- **`utils/sign_storage.py`** - Reference data loading
  - `load_all_sign_sequences()` - Loads all signs from disk
  - Returns dict: `{sign_name: [(left_hand, right_hand), ...]}`

## UI & DEBUG REQUIREMENTS ✅

### On-Screen Messages (cv2.putText):
```
✅ "Press 'r' to record/recognize | 'q' to quit"  (Top-left help text)
✅ "🎥 Recording Gesture... (X/50 frames)"        (During recording)
✅ "Recognized Sign: <label>"                     (Bottom center result)
✅ "No reference signs available"                 (If no signs exist)
```

### Debug Console Output:
```
✅ "Signs directory: data\signs"
✅ "✓ Loaded 2 sign sequences from 1 signs"
✅ "✓ SignRecorder initialized in 'record' mode"
✅ "✓ Loaded 1 reference signs"
✅ "Recording: X frames collected"                (Per frame)
✅ "=== Processing sequence of 50 frames ==="    (Start DTW)
✅ "DTW Distances: {'hello': 1029.9944, ...}"   (All distances)
✅ "✓ Best match: 'hello' (distance: 1029.9944)" (Final result)
✅ "✓ Saved sign 'hello' (50 frames) to ..."     (After saving)
```

### Text Drawing Implementation:
```python
# All text drawn on SAME frame that's passed to cv2.imshow()
cv2.putText(frame, text, (x, y), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, size, color, thickness)
cv2.imshow("OpenCV Feed", frame)
```

## GENERAL CONSTRAINTS ✅

- ✅ **CPU-Only**: Runs on normal laptop (no GPU required)
- ✅ **No Deep Learning**: Uses only DTW + hand angle features
- ✅ **MediaPipe Landmarks**: Leverages MediaPipe Holistic model
- ✅ **Preserves Hand Tracking**: Existing MediaPipe pipeline untouched
- ✅ **Clean & Modular**: Separated concerns (storage, recording, UI)
- ✅ **Readable Code**: Clear naming, docstrings, type hints

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Data Flow

**Recording Mode:**
```
User Input → MediaPipe Detection → Landmark Extraction → 50-Frame Collection
    ↓
SignModel Creation → Save to Disk (NPY + Metadata)
```

**Recognition Mode:**
```
Load Saved Signs (Memory) → Start Webcam → MediaPipe Detection
    ↓
Landmark Extraction → 50-Frame Collection → SignModel Creation
    ↓
DTW Distance Computation (vs all reference signs) → Min Distance Selection
    ↓
Display Result on Frame
```

### Class Responsibilities

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------------|
| `SignRecorder` | Record/recognize logic, DTW computation |
| `WebcamManager` | Display, landmarks drawing, text rendering |
| `SignStorage` | Persist/load sequences from disk |
| `SignModel` | Create hand angle features |
| `HandModel` | Extract angle vectors between landmarks |
